### Code from the Final Degree Project in Artificial Intelligence titled Genetic Algorithms for Molecular Modelling: Redesigning Evolutionary Operators to Improve Efficiency, by Arnau Sol√© Porta

I have uploaded here all the code that I could share, which are all the files and functions that were entirely coded by me. However, part of the development consisted in the modification of previous functions or files. These cannot be shown.

In the folder 'Visualization' there are all the necessary files to be able to reproduce any graph or metric presented in the final report, through the use of the notebook 'Run_Visualization.ipynb'.

In the folder 'Code' there are the following files:
-models.py: A file that if executed will reproduce the training of a deep learning model as the one presented in section 4 of the project report. It uses the data from the folder 'training_data'. 
-Functions.py: A file with the deep-learning based mutation function, the elite-guided mutation function, the self-adaptive mutation function and the multi-parent crossover function.
